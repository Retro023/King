# King
This small tool auto adds your user name to the king text file in koth matches

to use this tool replace the USERNAME with your username and the king.txt with what ever the king.txt file is called in your game

tips for use;
the best use case is to hide this script somewhere and make it a crontab that runs as root so every minute or amount of time specified by you your name will be entered 
in the king.txt file. also make sure to configure the cronjob properly as to not allow others to take your script and priv esc of it :)

I will also be updating this script trying to make it more useable
